<p><b>What is media literacy and why is it important?</b></p>
<p>In short, media literacy is the ability to
think critically about the information you
consume and create. It includes the ability
to distinguish fact from opinion, and to
understand how media can sometimes be
used to persuade people. Media literacy is
important because it is the basis for being
an informed and critical thinker in a world
where technology and media are
ubiquitous, helping to immunize people
against undue persuasion and false
information. </p>

<p><b>What is fake news and why do people create it?</b><p>
<p>Fake news is any information that is
deliberately meant to be wholly or largely
false or misleading. Motivations for
creating fake news include financial gain –
by getting people to click on sites so
they’re exposed to advertising – or to
persuade others to take an action,
purchase a product, or support or oppose
a cause or political candidate. Some
people perpetuate fake news just for the
sake of deceiving people or as a prank.
Honest mistakes happen and they are not
fake news. But those who publish or say
something that they later find out to be
untrue have an obligation to correct the
record. </p>

<p><b>How do we explain the difference
between facts and opinions?</b></p>
<p>Both fact and opinion help us understand
the world around us. Facts are accurate 
reports of what happened or what exists,
while opinions are an interpretation of
the meaning or impact, usually from an
individual's perspective. It’s legitimate for
an opinion to be influenced by a person’s
world view, but even those who express
an opinion should back them up with
facts rather than inaccurate information. </p>

<p><b>How can you spot fake news?</b></p>
<p>Consider the source and other stories
coming from that source. Do they ring
true? Is the URL legitimate? Does the
“news story” seem one-sided or biased
toward a particular point of view? Also,
consider the article’s author. Is there
evidence that it’s a real person? Search
for the source and author to see what
else they’ve published and what others
are saying about them. Sometimes you
can tell if a story is true by copying a
string of its text and pasting it into a
search engine. Often (but not always) this
will bring up sites that may dispute or
confirm the story, but it may also bring
up other fake news sites that repeat the
story. FactCheck.org has other good tips
for spotting fake news. </p>

<p><b>What is the right thing to do when you
spot fake news?</b></p>
<p>While it’s never OK to spread fake news,
it is OK to comment on links to fake
stories with your own correction, to help
set the record straight. </p>
